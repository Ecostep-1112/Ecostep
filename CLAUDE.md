This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
Ecostep is a mobile app concept that combines environmental protection with a fish-raising game. The app encourages users to track and reduce plastic usage while gamifying the experience through virtual fish care.

## Core Features

### Main Tabs
1. **Home Tab**: Fish aquarium display with plastic/CO2 savings stats
2. **Challenge Tab**: 
   - Habit challenges (e.g., "No plastic straws for a week")
   - Plastic usage tracking with weekly goals
3. **Rewards Tab**: Store for purchasing fish and aquarium customizations
4. **Community Tab**: Friend rankings and global leaderboards
5. **Settings Tab**: Profile and app configuration

### Key Components
- **Fish System**: 12 different fish types, unlock based on user rank
- **Aquarium Customization**: Colors, seaweed, decorations
- **Tracking System**: Records plastic item usage (bottles, cups, containers) with weight calculations
- **Progress Visualization**: Charts and progress bars for goals and achievements
- **Social Features**: Friend invites via KakaoTalk, ID search, rankings

## Design Requirements

### UI/UX Guidelines
- Modern, clean design suitable for mobile devices
- Dark mode should follow Toss app's color scheme and design
- Mobile-first design with phone frame borders for realistic preview
- Android and iOS compatible aspect ratios
- Use appropriate icons throughout the interface

### Screen Layout
- Header with app name, points, and profile icon
- Large rectangular aquarium area on home screen
- Tab navigation at bottom
- Progress bars for challenges and goals
- List views for rankings and past challenges

## Development Notes
- This is currently a concept/design phase project
- Focus on creating responsive mobile layouts
- Implement gamification elements to encourage environmental behavior
- Ensure smooth transitions between tabs and screens
